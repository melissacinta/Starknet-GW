# Contributing to Starknet Global Wallet

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Starknet Global Wallet! We
appreciate your help in making this project better. This guide outlines the
basic steps for contributing.

## How to Contribute

Starknet Global Wallet uses OnlyDust to manage contributions. Here's the
process:

1. **Find an Issue:** Browse the open issues on our OnlyDust page
   [Starknet Global Wallet](https://app.onlydust.com/projects/starknet-global-wallet/overview).
   Look for issues labeled "good first issue" if you're new to the project, or
   other issues that interest you.

2. **Apply for the Issue:** If you'd like to work on an issue, click the "Apply"
   button on the OnlyDust issue page. This lets us know you're interested.

3. **Issue Assignment:** A project maintainer will review your application. If
   you're selected, the issue will be assigned to you on OnlyDust.

4. **Fork the Repository:** Fork the Starknet Global Wallet repository on GitHub
   to your own GitHub account.

5. **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your work. Use a descriptive
   branch name, like `feat/new-feature` or `fix/bug-fix`.

6. **Make Your Changes:** Make the necessary changes to the code. Follow the
   project's coding style and conventions. Be sure to test your changes
   thoroughly.

7. **Commit Your Changes:** Commit your changes with clear and concise commit
   messages. Use the present tense (e.g., "Add new feature" instead of "Added
   new feature").

8. **Create a Pull Request (PR):** Push your branch to your forked repository on
   GitHub. Then, create a pull request from your branch to the main branch of
   the Starknet Global Wallet repository.

9. **PR Review:** A project maintainer will review your PR. They may request
   changes or provide feedback. Address any comments and push updated code to
   your branch.

10. **Merge:** Once the review is complete and the PR is approved, a maintainer
    will merge your changes into the main branch.
